# 🦁 Conservatory Blueprint
**Version 2.0**

**The Concept:** You are competing Zoo Directors. You have a master plan (your sheet) and a team of contractors (the action cards). Each round, you decide which contractor to hire **Full Time** (The Leader Bonus). You also utilize the contractors your opponents hired, but only Part-Time (The Follower Action).

*   **Players:** 2–6
*   **Time:** 30–45 Minutes
*   **Components:** 1 Game Sheet per player, 4 Action Cards per player, 1 six-sided Die (d6) for small counts.

---

## 📜 The Player Sheet
1.  **The Zoning Grid:** A 10x10 grid of **dots** (making it easy to draw fence lines).
2.  **The Animal Registry:** A list of 12 animals, categorized by Biome.
3.  **The Warehouse:** A track for **Coins** (Currency) and **Appeal** (Victory Points).

---

## 🎭 Setup: Director Profiles
At the start of the game, deal 1 random **Director Profile** to each player. This is your unique ability for the game.

1.  **The Architect:** When taking the **Build (Leader)** action, draw **7 Fences** instead of 5.
2.  **The Botanist:** When taking the **Landscape (Leader)** action, you may fill **4 Squares** instead of 3.
3.  **The Investor:** Start the game with **10 Coins**.
4.  **The Veterinarian:** You may ignore **1 Terrain Requirement** (Symbol) when Populating an animal. (Size requirement must still be met).
5.  **The Marketer:** Every time you build a **Kiosk**, gain **1 Appeal** immediately (in addition to end-game points).
6.  **The Engineer:** You may build Fences and Kiosks **on top of** existing terrain symbols (destroying the terrain) to fix mistakes.

## 🃏 The 4 Action Cards
Every round, players secretly choose **1 Card** and reveal simultaneously.

*   **If you chose it:** You take the **Leader Action** (Stronger).
*   **If you didn't choose it, but an opponent did:** You take the **Follower Action** (Weaker).
*   **If no one chose it:** See "The Neutral Partner" rule below.

### 1. 🚧 BUILD (Infrastructure)
*   **Leader:** Draw **5 Fence Lines** (connect dots) AND place **1 Kiosk**.
*   **Follower:** Draw **3 Fence Lines**.
    *   **Fencing Rules:** You may connect dots in any direction (orthogonal). You **may** share fence lines between two adjacent enclosures (a single line acts as a wall for both).
    *   **Kiosk Rules:** Kiosks (Burger stand, Toilet, Gift Shop) fill 1 Square. They **MUST** be placed **OUTSIDE** of enclosures. They cannot be placed inside a finished cage.

### 2. 🚜 LANDSCAPE (Terrain)
*   **Leader:** Draw **3 Terrain Symbols** in empty squares.
*   **Follower:** Draw **1 Terrain Symbol**.
    *   **Symbols:** Tree 🌲, Rock 🪨, Water 💧, or Grass 🌾.
    *   **Restriction:** You cannot place terrain in a square that already has a building or animal. You *can* place terrain in an area not yet fenced in.

### 3. 🐾 POPULATE (Animals)
*   **Leader:** Check off **1 Animal** from your list and write its "Code" (e.g., L for Lion) in a valid enclosure. **Gain 3 Coins.**
*   **Follower:** Check off **1 Animal** and write its Code. **Cost: 2 Coins.** (If you cannot pay, you cannot Populate).
    *   **Requirement:** You must have a **Completed Enclosure** (fully closed loop) that meets the Animal's **Size** AND **Terrain** needs.

### 4. 💰 SPONSOR (Finance)
*   **Leader:** Gain **5 Coins** AND **1 Appeal**.
*   **Follower:** Gain **2 Coins**.
    *   *Usage:* Coins pay for the "Follower" Populate action.
    *   *Black Market:* At any time, you may spend **3 Coins** to buy **1 Fence Line**.

---

## 👥 Scaling: The "Neutral Partner" Rule
*Required for 2 or 3 players.*

In low-player games, not enough actions trigger naturally.
1.  Assign numbers to the actions: (1) Build, (2) Landscape, (3) Populate, (4) Sponsor.
2.  After players reveal their cards, roll a **d6**.
    *   **1–4:** The rolled action triggers as if a "Neutral Player" selected it.
    *   **5–6:** Re-roll.
3.  **Resolution:**
    *   If you **did not** pick this card, take the **Follower Action** for the rolled number.
    *   If you **did** pick this card, nothing extra happens (you already take the Leader action).

## 🦁 The "Zoo Tycoon" Puzzle

To place an animal, you need a closed loop of fences. Inside that loop, you must have the specific amount of empty space (Size) and the specific Terrain symbols drawn.

**Important:** Squares containing Kiosks **do not** count toward enclosure size (as Kiosks are outside).

### The Savannah Zone
| Animal | Size Needed | Terrain Requirements | Code | Appeal (VP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zebra** | 4 Sq | 2 Grass 🌾 | Z | 5 |
| **Giraffe** | 5 Sq | 2 Grass 🌾, 1 Tree 🌲 | G | 7 |
| **Lion** | 6 Sq | 2 Rock 🪨, 1 Water 💧 | L | 8 |
| **Elephant** | 8 Sq | 3 Water 💧, 2 Tree 🌲 | E | 12 |

### The Wetland Zone
| Animal | Size Needed | Terrain Requirements | Code | Appeal (VP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flamingo** | 3 Sq | 1 Water 💧 | F | 4 |
| **Crocodile**| 5 Sq | 3 Water 💧, 1 Rock 🪨 | C | 7 |
| **Dolphin** | 7 Sq | 5 Water 💧 (Must be on map edge)| D | 10 |

### The Alpine & Exotic Zone
| Animal | Size Needed | Terrain Requirements | Code | Appeal (VP) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Penguin** | 2 Sq | 1 Rock 🪨, 1 Water 💧 | N | 4 |
| **Monkey** | 3 Sq | 2 Tree 🌲 | M | 5 |
| **Panda** | 4 Sq | 3 Tree 🌲 | P | 8 |

## 🏆 Scoring
The game ends when a player has filled **10 Animals** OR the **Appeal Track** reaches 50. Complete the current round, then score.

### 1. Positive Points (+)
*   **Animals:** Sum of Appeal (VP) for all checked animals.
*   **Kiosks:** **2 VP** per Kiosk placed on the map.
*   **Coin Reserves:** **1 VP** per 3 Coins remaining.

### 2. Penalties (-)
*   **Unused Landscape:** **-1 VP** for every Terrain symbol (🌲,🪨,💧,🌾) that is **not** inside a populated enclosure. (This punishes over-preparing and failing to fill the cages).
*   **Orphan Fences:** **-1 VP** for every fence line that is not part of a completed, closed loop. (Clean up your construction site!)

**Tiebreaker:** Most Cash remaining.

## ⚡ Strategic Notes
*   **Kiosk Blocking:** Since Kiosks must be outside, they are excellent for "filling gaps" between cages to maximize space, but be careful—if you surround an area with Kiosks, you might not be able to run a fence line through them later.
*   **Shared Walls:** Using one line to separate a Lion and a Zebra is efficient (saves 1 action), but risky if you haven't drawn the terrain yet.
*   **The Grass Trap:** Don't forget that Savannah animals specifically need **Grass** symbols. An empty square is just dirt! You must spend Landscape actions to grow the grass.
